# Twisted Space
This is my first Hyprland rice so it has only the basic stuff like Rofi, Waybar and basic theming.

# Installation
Run
```
bash <(curl -s "https://github.com/Boomyboomer123/twisted-space/install.sh")
```
in your terminal or download and run "install.sh"

# Credits:
GeodeArc - A lot of code from this rice was "inspired" by his [GeoDots](https://github.com/GeodeArc/GeoDots) (IMO the best rice ever)
Aditya Shakya (adi1090x) - For the clean [Rofi designs](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) used in this rice
