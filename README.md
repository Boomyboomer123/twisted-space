# Twisted Space

This is my first Hyprland rice so it has only the basic stuff like Rofi, Waybar, a GTK theme, a Kvantum theme and an icon theme.

# Installation
Run
```
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Boomyboomer123/twisted-space/refs/heads/main/install.sh")
```
in your terminal or download and run "install.sh"
